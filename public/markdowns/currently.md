I'm currently working with a group of developers and designers to further develop an open-source web application.

<div className="md-center-img">

<div>

The app provides a GUI to allow a user to customize the look and feel of a webchat instance, see the results of these customizations, and export the custom settings to their own web-chat instance.

The basic framework and proof-of-concept was already been built out by a member of Microsoft's web-chat team. 

Our group is working to add a more robust feature set to this app, as well as an improved design and user-experience. The most recent version (shown below) has an option to change every customization currently offered by the webchat API. Our designer is currently working on wireframes for the layout, as well as for each of the various selector types. (ie color, percentage, integer, css...)

Our hope is that this application will make working with Microsoft's chat bot framework more accessible to everyone.

We anticipate this application will prove useful for many developers in this workspace.

Check back soon for future updates!
