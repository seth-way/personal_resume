This was another quick, time-boxed coding challenge that I decided to take on.

In a single day, I built this React-based web-app without using any CSS.

The app accurately tracks and displays frame scores for a bowling game. The user simply chooses how many pins to knock down on a given throw, and the app handles the rest. The logic for this is certainly achievable, but I found it much more challenging than I originally anticipated.

The current state of the app meets the requirements for an MVP and does what it was intended to do.

Given more time, I would have liked to add a feature to allow for multiple players during a single game.
