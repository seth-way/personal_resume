For this project, I worked with a group of developers and designers to further develop an open-source web application.

This app provides a GUI to allow a user to customize the look and feel of a webchat instance, see the results of these customizations, and export the custom settings to their own web-chat instance.

The basic framework and proof-of-concept had already been built out by a member of Microsoft's web-chat team.

Our group worked to add a more robust feature set to this app, as well as an improved design and user-experience.

Our goal was to make working with Microsoft's chat bot framework more accessible to everyone.

The application proved useful and ownership of the concept was passed over to a member of Microsoft's webchat team!
